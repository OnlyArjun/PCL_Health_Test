# 👨‍⚕️👨‍⚕️ PCL_Health_Test 👨‍⚕️👨‍⚕️

Android application made to accomplish PCL Health Android Test.
It was given to build a **Height Measurement Picker** that will let users scroll to their choices or can also click choices to confirm them.

The application uses **MVVM architecture** in its overall development. All the UIs and UX are as per the Figma Design given by the PCL Health Co.

RecyclerView is used to build the basic scroll view. The updates of the UI according to the selections are done using the **ViewModel** concerned with the home screen.

Also, the button click will show a TOAST to the users that contains their current selection. Users can also change their current measurement unit by clicking on the switch.
